# Changelog

All notable changes to OUTKAST are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
LibreNostr is a fork of [Primal](https://github.com/PrimalHQ/primal-android-app)
(MIT, Copyright (c) 2023 PRIMAL SYSTEMS INC.); this log covers changes made in
the LibreNostr/OUTKAST fork on top of the imported `3.5.25` baseline.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- **Photo editor before upload.** A photo picked from the gallery or taken with the camera, for a note,
  a reply or a profile picture or banner, now opens in an editor before it is attached: crop (free,
  original, square, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9), rotate, flip, straighten, vertical and horizontal perspective,
  exposure, brightness, contrast, highlights, shadows, black point, saturation, vibrance, temperature,
  tint, sharpness, vignette, eight filters with an adjustable strength, and an Auto button that proposes
  the sliders from the picture. Hold the picture to see the original. Done with nothing changed attaches
  the photo exactly as it was, untouched; Done with edits draws them at full size (up to 12 megapixels)
  into a new JPEG with no metadata at all, so the location and camera details of the original do not
  travel with the edited copy. Videos, GIFs, SVGs and animated WebPs skip the editor. The engine is the
  one from the eikon gallery (MIT), with its tests. The labels exist in English and Italian; other
  languages fall back to English for now.
- **Network, a new section of Discover.** Notes by people you do not follow that people you do follow
  liked or reposted in the last 48 hours, newest first. Everything is computed on the phone from your
  follow list and your friends' reactions, in a handful of relay requests and with no ranking server;
  a note needs two friends behind it when you follow 40 people or more. This is the nearest honest
  version of "popular among friends of friends": nostrich.org's Explore, which was the model, does not
  work that way, it shows global trending notes ranked by an external index.

### Fixed

- **Mute did not stick, and did not reach everything.** Opening any profile or the muted accounts screen
  while the relays were slow replaced the stored mute list with an empty one (a relay answering nothing
  was taken for "you muted nobody"), so muted people came straight back into the feeds. A relay that
  returns no mute list now leaves the stored one alone, while a list that is really empty still empties
  it. A mute now shows at once and is taken back if it cannot be published, instead of looking
  unresponsive for the several seconds the relays need. Muted people are also left out of Notifications
  (replies, mentions, reactions, zaps) and Messages (the conversation and its unread badge), which the
  mute list never reached, and a muted account whose profile was never fetched is listed in the muted
  accounts screen so it can be unmuted.
- **Unfollow did nothing visible.** Unfollowing changed the button only: the person kept feeding the home
  feed for up to five minutes because the follow list the feeds read is cached for that long, and their
  notes already in the feed were never removed. The newly published list now replaces the cache and the
  unfollowed person's notes leave the following feed. A relay that had not received the latest list could
  also hand back an older one, which silently undid the last follow or unfollow; the newest list wins now,
  both when reading it and when building the next change on it. Following or unfollowing no longer
  deletes the hashtags you follow from your follow list either.
- **A custom reaction came back as the red heart.** The orange heart, the thumbs up or any other emoji you
  react with now stays on the note you reacted to, for you, instead of the stock heart. It is remembered
  per note and also read back from the relays for reactions made on another device or client.
- **Tagged people showed as an npub.** A mention was saved with the person's name only if that person's
  profile was part of the same relay response as the note; profiles fetched on an earlier page, which is
  most of them, left the shortened npub in the note for good. Mentions are now resolved against every
  profile already stored, mentions written only in the text (no `p` tag) get their profile fetched too,
  and notes saved earlier with an npub are rewritten as soon as the name arrives.
- **"Rispondi" was cut to "Rispo".** The six tool icons under the reply field took the room of the button.
  The button is measured first now, the icons are 40dp wide instead of 48dp and scroll sideways if the
  screen is still too narrow. The label is one line in every language.

### Changed

- The local database moves to version 7 (the user's own reaction is stored per note); the update is
  automatic and keeps everything.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Dragging sideways along the portal (the pill at the bottom of the screen that opens Orbit) runs
  through the worlds while the finger is still down, one world every 36dp, so a single stroke can
  cross all of them. The finger moving left goes to the next world, right to the previous one, like
  the swipe on the content. Dragging up still opens Orbit and a tap still opens it too; a short
  stroke that ends on the portal no longer opens Orbit by accident.

### Changed

- Orbit is reorganized. The tiles now read Feed, Inbox, Long reads, Discover, Messages, Bookmarks,
  You, Settings. The Algorithms and Discover tiles, which both read as "the algorithm place", are
  merged into one: it opens a panel with an entry into the Discover world and, below it, your own
  feed list as before.
- Messages has its own Orbit tile with its own unread badge. The Activity/Messages switch at the top
  of Inbox is gone, and the Inbox tile now counts notifications only.
- Swiping between worlds follows the order of the Orbit menu: Feed, Inbox, Long reads, Discover. It
  used to be Feed, Discover, Long reads, Inbox. The slide towards Messages and Settings follows the
  same order, with Messages after every world (it used to sit between Feed and Inbox).
- The swipe from the screen edge now belongs to the lower half of the screen, where the thumb is,
  and the upper half is left to the system back gesture. The band where the back gesture is turned
  off moved from the middle of each edge to the bottom. Android allows at most 200dp of it per edge,
  so on a tall phone it does not cover the whole lower half; above it, a swipe that starts a little
  inside the edge still changes world.

### Removed

- The Create (+) button on the Settings screens, where there is nothing to post from.
## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- Swiping up on a photo or video in the full-screen viewer opens the note's thread, with its
  replies, rising from the bottom of the screen. The Reply button still opens the editor. The swipe
  is ignored while the photo is zoomed in, so moving around a magnified picture cannot leave the
  viewer.

### Fixed

- Swiping between Feed, Discover, Long reads and Inbox failed on phones with gesture navigation:
  the edge strip lay inside the area Android reserves for the back gesture, which took the swipe.
  Android lets an app take only 200dp of each edge away from the back gesture, so the edge swipe
  alone could not fix this: measured on a phone, a swipe from the edge at any other height was read
  as "back" (second world to the first, first world out of the app). The swipe now also works from
  anywhere on the screen, like a pager: left for the next world, right for the previous one.
  Horizontal scrollers keep their own swipes (photo carousels, the sections of Discover and Long
  reads) and hand the swipe over only when they are on their last page. The edge swipe stays as a
  shortcut that wins over them, protected from the back gesture in the middle of each edge.
- The same swipe only ever worked for the first two worlds: the gesture kept the destination it was
  given when the screen first appeared, so after one move it kept aiming at the same place. It now
  always uses the world currently showing.
- The edge strip no longer swallows taps and vertical scrolls that start at the edge of the screen;
  it takes over only once a finger has clearly started moving inward.
- Picking, in Orbit, the feed that is already showing (Home → Recent, or Recent with replies) did
  nothing. It now refreshes that feed and scrolls it to the top.
- The app crashed when the Feed gallery section of Discover came on screen if the same feed had been
  received twice (it is fetched from several relays): the list used the feed's identity as its key
  and refused the duplicate. Duplicates are now dropped before the list is built. Swiping through
  the sections of Discover reaches this section far more easily than the section picker did.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-13

### Highlights

- Introduced OUTKAST Orbit, a gesture-first navigation model with no persistent bottom bar.
- Added inward edge swipes to move between Feed, Discover, Long reads and Inbox with directional
  transitions, plus a pull-up/tap portal for discoverable navigation.
- Centered the OUTKAST wordmark and “You don’t need permission to exist online.” tagline in the
  Feed header; removed the Latest control and the duplicate header avatar entry point.

### Navigation and workflows

- Home now opens an explicit Recent / Recent with replies choice.
- Algorithms now opens inside Orbit, retaining the complete feed list and advanced-search editing
  without the old side drawer.
- Long reads, Discover and Inbox are first-class Orbit destinations while their existing paging,
  notifications and messages behavior remains intact.
- Bookmarks, Profile and Settings are now equal-sized Orbit actions; Profile is no longer duplicated
  in the header, and Settings is no longer hidden behind an unreachable navigation bar.
- Compose remains globally available as a floating action.

### Product and compatibility

- Removed the legacy navigation-bar component and the algorithm/bookmark side drawer from the active
  UI path.
- Renamed the built-in default note feeds to Recent and Recent with replies.
- Preserved `applicationId = com.librenostr.android`, version upgrade compatibility, relay identity,
  databases, DataStore state, Android Keystore aliases, provider authorities and release signing.
- Release artifact is `outkast-2.0.0-arm64-v8a.apk`, signed with the configured alternative release
  keystore.

### Verification

- `:app:compileDebugKotlin` passed.
- `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed.
- `:app:assembleDebug` passed.
- Final `altRelease` build and APK signature verification are performed as part of the 2.0.0 release
  handoff.

### Added

- OUTKAST launcher, adaptive and themed icons derived from the supplied O/K artwork.
- A direct onboarding choice between creating a new identity and bringing an existing one.
- Four gesture-connected content worlds — Feed, Discover, Long reads and Inbox — with a global Create action.
- An explicit compatibility and regression plan in `docs/OUTKAST_MIGRATION.md`.

### Changed

- Replaced the persistent navigation dock with OUTKAST Orbit: edge swipes move through Feed,
  Discover, Long reads and Inbox, while a compact pull-up portal exposes the complete map and
  Bookmarks. Compose remains a floating global action.
- Removed the legacy algorithm/bookmark drawer and every duplicate header shortcut. Orbit now
  owns Recent/Recent with replies, the complete algorithm list, Long reads, Bookmarks, Profile and
  Settings; all utility tiles share the same compact geometry.
- Replaced the Home controls with a centered OUTKAST wordmark and the product tagline.
- Rebranded user-facing application, manifest labels, store metadata and release artifacts to OUTKAST.
- Replaced eight legacy themes with curated OUTKAST Dark and OUTKAST Light identities. Existing saved theme values migrate by luminance and system-following remains available.
- Connected Discover to the existing people, search, feeds, zaps and media experience; Inbox now exposes Activity and Messages together.
- Reworked onboarding, empty-state and publishing copy around progressive disclosure and plain Nostr language.

### Compatibility

- Preserved `com.librenostr.android`, signing configuration, provider authorities, databases, DataStore files and Keystore access for in-place upgrades.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- **Quotes: a counter and a list.** A note's stats line now shows how many notes quote it, and tapping
  it opens a new Quotes tab next to Zaps, Likes and Reposts. The tab lists the quoting notes
  themselves, as full cards, and a tap on one opens that note's thread. Quotes are found the two
  ways clients write them (a `q` tag, or an `e` mention with the note's link in the text), and a
  reply that happens to embed the note it answers is still counted as a reply. Notes you quote now
  carry a `q` tag as well, which is what other clients look for.
- **React with any emoji.** A long press on the heart opens a picker with six common reactions and
  the whole emoji list. A reaction on a note you already reacted to replaces the old one. The Likes
  list shows each person's emoji instead of a heart where they sent one.
- **Comments the NIP-22 way (kind 1111).** Comments on an article, and replies to those comments, are
  now published as kind 1111 with the article as the root and the comment as the parent, and read
  back as a tree: replies under an article are drawn nested, the way thread replies are. Replies to
  ordinary notes stay NIP-10 kind 1, as the NIP says. Comments of both kinds, including the kind 1111
  ones other clients write under plain notes, appear in threads and in notifications.

### Changed

- **A tap on a filled heart takes the reaction back.** It used to do nothing, so a mistaken reaction
  could not be undone. The reaction is withdrawn with a deletion request and the heart empties at
  once; if the request cannot be published, the heart is filled again.
- **GIF search uses LibreNostr's nostr.build access.** Results come from nostr.build with the
  app's registered key instead of falling back to GIFverse, in one request of up to 200 GIFs (no more
  paging), searched the way the service asks (trimmed, lower case, no single letters). The picker says
  "GIFs from nostr.build" with a link to the site, as the service's terms require. When the service
  limits the app, the picker says so and stops asking until the limit lifts instead of switching
  provider. Release builds get the key from a repository secret and fail loudly without it.
- **Upload errors say what the servers answered.** "Unable to upload file" now carries each server's
  own words (for instance "Access denied (403)" or "File size exceeds the maximum allowed size of
  20 MiB"), so a refusal is no longer indistinguishable from a bad connection.

### Fixed

- **Uploads failed over Tor.** blossom.band and blossom.nostr.build refuse uploads that arrive
  through a Tor exit, and cdn.satellite.earth wants an upload permission nobody has by default, so with
  the default servers every upload failed. While every connection goes through Tor, servers that accept
  anonymous uploads (cdn.nostrcheck.me, cdn.hzrd149.com) now come right after your own.
- **Videos could not be uploaded.** The default server takes at most 20 MiB and a phone video is
  usually far larger, so every default server refused it. Large files are now offered to each server
  first and skipped by the ones that say no, without sending the file, and two more servers that take
  large files are tried when none of the configured ones will. Progress is also reported in larger
  steps, which spared a long upload tens of thousands of redraws.
- **The media tab of a profile never loaded.** It asked a centralized service that this build does not
  have. It now reads the author's notes from the relays and shows the ones with a picture or a video.
- **Article comments never loaded.** The article itself was looked up with a filter that relays do not
  match, so the page found no article and, with it, no comments.
- **A like that could not be published stayed counted.** The failed reaction left the counter raised
  and the heart filled until the next refresh. The same went for reposts and zaps.
- **Files mirrored onto the server that already had them.** When the first server refused an upload
  and a later one took it, the mirroring still included the one that took it.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **Older notes were fetched while scrolling but never shown.** Loading more notes stored them in
  the database without telling the list, whose query deliberately does not watch that table, so
  the list kept what it had and looked as if it had stopped loading. The new notes only appeared
  when something unrelated (a like, a mute, a bookmark sync) happened to refresh it. Every page
  added to a feed now refreshes the list.
- **Returning to the feed could skip notes or stop paging.** The feed is replaced with its newest
  page whenever the screen comes back into view, but the loader still remembered how far back the
  previous scroll had gone: the next page started there, skipping everything in between, or, when
  it repeated a request from a few seconds earlier, ended the list for good. It now starts over
  from the new page.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- **Dark Pixel is the default theme.** It applies to anyone who never picked a theme: a fresh
  install, or an existing one that never opened the appearance settings, no longer follows the
  system's light/dark setting. A theme you chose stays, and so does "adjust to the system" if you
  turned that on.

### Fixed

- **Older notes stopped loading while scrolling.** A page that no relay answered (a dropped
  connection, relays still backing off after one) was read as "there is nothing older", and four of
  those in a row ended the feed for good, which could happen within a second of a signal glitch. An
  unanswered page now changes nothing and is asked again on the next scroll, after two quick retries.
  The same walk had two more ways to stall or skip: a page made only of replies, which a notes feed
  hides, looked empty even though older notes were behind it, and a busy group of followed accounts
  could push the page past notes it had not been read to yet, losing them; and when the list was
  hiding every note a page had just stored, the next request jumped six hours back instead of
  continuing from where the page ended.
- **Long reads disappeared from the Reads tab.** A refresh that no relay answered replaced the
  cached articles with nothing, and that refresh runs whenever the cache is a few minutes old. It now
  keeps what it had. Two quick scrolls could also end the list permanently (the guard against
  repeating a request closed it instead of skipping the repeat), and the whole follow list went out
  as one filter that relays with a size limit refuse; it is now split into groups of 250 authors,
  like the note feed.
- **Profile header said "Followed by" over the wrong list.** The people shown are the ones the
  profile follows and you follow too, not its followers. It now reads "Following".
- **Polls could not be published with an external signer.** Kinds 1068 (poll) and 6969 (zap poll)
  were missing from the set of kinds sent to Amber or a NIP-46 bunker, so both were refused before
  anything was sent and reported as a generic publish error. Voting already worked.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- **GIFs from nostr.build.** The GIF picker now searches nostr.build's index of GIFs uploaded to its
  free public pool, replacing the Wikimedia Commons search. It opens with results and one-tap topic
  chips (gm, lol, bitcoin…), suggests search terms as you type, and posts the GIF by its URL with a
  NIP-92 `imeta` tag (type, dimensions, size, alt text) instead of downloading and re-uploading it.
  nostr.build only serves registered clients, and LibreNostr is not registered yet: until it is, the
  picker answers from GIFverse (the index Ditto uses) and says so in its "Powered by" line. Once the
  registration is done it switches to nostr.build by itself, with no update needed.
- **Custom emoji packs (NIP-30).** `:shortcode:` in a note is drawn as the image the note declares.
  The composer has a new emoji panel with the built-in LibreNostr Ostrich pack and the packs on your
  emoji list (kind 10030), and published notes carry the matching `emoji` tags. Settings has a new
  Emoji packs screen to browse packs from your relays, add one from an `naddr` link, and create,
  edit or delete your own (images are uploaded to your Blossom servers).

### Fixed

- A single failing relay could stall every load in the app — notes, direct messages and
  notifications alike. Every finished query re-dialled each unreachable relay just to close its
  subscription while holding one of the few query slots the whole app shares, so a dead relay
  starved the others until their queries timed out empty. Closing a subscription no longer opens a
  connection; a relay that fails to connect is now left alone for a growing interval (2 seconds up
  to 5 minutes, at least a minute when the server refuses outright) and is retried at once when the
  network changes, when the Tor mode changes, or when you reconnect it by hand; concurrent callers
  share a single connection attempt; and DM and publish operations no longer connect to their relays
  one after another before starting.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Deck mode crashed immediately on any tablet, as soon as it activated (opening the app in
  landscape, or rotating into it). Each column sets up its own view-model store so closing it
  frees what it opened, but that store wasn't wired to Hilt's dependency injection, so the very
  first view model a column tried to create — its feed — crashed instead.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-29

LibreNostr's first stable release. Every data path in the app — feeds, profiles, threads,
notifications, DMs, search, bookmarks, mute lists — has run directly against Nostr relays since the
0.x series; this release adds a tablet layout on top of that and closes a long list of bugs found in
a full review of the app, several of which could silently lose data.

### Added

- **Deck mode for tablets.** Hold a tablet in landscape and LibreNostr switches to a multi-column
  layout in the style of notedeck; rotate back to portrait and you get the usual tabbed app. Phones
  never switch, in either orientation.
  - Several named decks, switched from a sidebar; each can be renamed, reordered or deleted.
  - Columns for any of your feeds, a hashtag, a profile, Reads, notifications and messages. A
    profile column can be picked by name, NIP-05 address, npub or hex key.
  - Columns can be rearranged by drag and drop (or with the arrow buttons in the column header).
  - Opening a note, a profile or a DM conversation from a column opens it inside that same column,
    with a back button to return to the column's feed, instead of leaving the deck.
  - The deck layout is saved on the device, separately for each of your profiles.
- Advanced search now understands `OR` between words, `-word` to exclude a word,
  `filter:image`/`filter:video`/`filter:audio`, and the custom date range from the date picker (which
  was previously ignored).

### Changed

- **Search is much faster.** Many relays answer a full-text search request by refusing it; the app
  used to miss that refusal and wait out a timeout of several seconds before trying the fallback,
  on every step of every search. It now moves on immediately.
- Profile search shows matches already stored on the device straight away and refines them as
  relays answer; typing a new query cancels the previous search instead of letting its results
  arrive late and overwrite the new ones.
- Hashtag feeds and hashtag columns are in chronological order, newest first. Searching `#bitcoin`
  could previously show posts from years ago at the top.
- Loading more notes no longer skips newer notes held only by slower relays: a page is closed only
  once enough of your relays have answered, not as soon as the fastest one fills it.
- Feeds you are not looking at (another tab, a removed deck column) no longer keep a live relay
  subscription open in the background, saving battery and data.

### Fixed

- **Mute list and bookmarks could be wiped.** Muting, unmuting or bookmarking while relays were slow
  to answer could publish a list containing only that one change, replacing everything else on
  your relays. Private (encrypted) entries and entries written by other clients were also dropped
  on every edit. Edits now always start from your latest published list and keep everything they
  don't change.
- With more than one profile in the app, bookmarks and notifications of one profile could overwrite
  those of another when both had bookmarked the same note or received the same notification.
- The extra relays LibreNostr adds to reach people you follow who publish elsewhere were also sent
  your relay login (NIP-42 AUTH) and your private requests (DMs, private lists). They are now
  read-only helpers used for public content only.
- Profile names and pictures could flip back to an older version when a relay holding an outdated
  copy answered last.
- An author could stay shown as a raw npub for the rest of the session if a screen was closed while
  their profile was still loading.
- Loading older notifications could skip some between one page and the next.
- The notification badge never came back after you had opened the notifications once, until the
  app was restarted.
- Tapping the "new notes" pill replaced the feed with just the new notes, dropping everything
  already loaded below them.
- Replying from inside a thread with the undo timer enabled showed no countdown, so the reply
  seemed to do nothing for several seconds, and leaving the thread in that window discarded it.
  The countdown now appears there too.
- A note could be published twice when "post now" was tapped as the undo countdown ran out.
- The media gallery failed to open images and videos whose address contains a query string.
- Unread message counts could come back after a conversation had been marked as read.
- Searching for text containing quotes or a backslash broke the search.
- Profile search no longer matches almost every profile on short queries (it used to match the
  profile data's field names and fragments of picture URLs).
- `bitcoin OR lightning` required both words instead of either, and a `since:`/`until:` date could
  be misread as a `kind:` filter that matched nothing.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- The note feed, notifications and DM conversations now show content noticeably faster: opening a
  reply's parent note, refreshing the feed, and loading notifications no longer wait on profile
  pictures/names or on interaction counts before showing anything — the note or notification itself
  appears first, names and counters fill in moments later.
- Opening a DM conversation no longer re-decrypts the whole inbox every time; it also runs off the
  main thread now, instead of occasionally freezing the app while it worked.
- Relay queries no longer wait far longer than intended when a relay is slow or unreachable: a
  single stuck query could previously hold up the screen for well over ten seconds; it's now capped
  consistently across the app.

### Fixed

- Some notes crashed the feed outright when their content matched more than one highlighted piece
  at the same spot (a hashtag inside a link, for instance).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- A local web of trust filter for the following feed (Settings > Web of Trust): hides notes and
  reposts from accounts you don't follow and that aren't followed by enough of the people you do
  follow. Entirely on-device — it reads only public follow lists already published to relays, no
  server involved.
- Relay addresses can now be plain `ws://` when they point at your own network: `localhost`,
  `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or a `.local` name, for a self-hosted relay with no certificate.
- `#bitcoin` renders as ₿ in Bitcoin's own orange; `#nostr`, `#grownostr` and `#asknostr` get a
  purple circle.

### Changed

- The relays LibreNostr adds on top of your own, to reach people you follow who don't publish to
  any of your configured relays, are now chosen by how many additional people they actually reach,
  not by how often a relay shows up overall — the same fixed number of relays now covers more of
  your follow list.

### Fixed

- Removed an unused CameraX manifest placeholder service that had no function but showed up as an
  unexplained entry to anyone inspecting the app's manifest.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- Redesigned onboarding: a new welcome screen, a relay-selection step that asks for at least three
  relays and shows your NIP-65 list when available, a privacy step that describes the built-in Tor
  engine and Orbot, and a step indicator across the flow. The gestures screen is gone.
- Redesigned bottom navigation: every destination now has a label, the selected one is highlighted with
  an animated pill, the compose button is labelled "Post", and Reads and Explore keep Home highlighted.
- Home now has Algorithms, Long reads and Bookmarks buttons under the top bar. They replace the swipe
  from the edges of Home and the long-reads overlay; the algorithm drawer opens from its button.
- Note actions animate when tapped. A like also gives a haptic tick and a short, quiet chime (skipped
  when the system's touch sounds are off).
- The zap sheets were restyled and give haptic feedback when you pick an amount and when you confirm.

### Removed

- The edge-swipe gestures on Home (right for algorithms, left for long reads); use the new buttons.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Built-in Tor powered by Arti, bundled for `arm64-v8a`, so Tor can run inside LibreNostr without
  installing another app.
- Tor settings now show the built-in engine state and bootstrap progress, alongside the existing
  Orbot engine.

### Changed

- Network routing now offers Direct, Tor for everything, and Only `.onion` addresses modes.
- Relay WebSockets, HTTP requests, media, uploads, and web pages follow the selected network mode;
  switching modes reconnects relay sockets through the new route.
- `.onion` relay addresses are accepted as cleartext WebSockets only when they are routed through
  Tor.

### Fixed

- Traffic that cannot be routed through the selected Tor mode is no longer silently fetched directly.
- Strict Tor mode fails closed when Tor is unavailable instead of falling back to a direct connection.

## [0.5.17] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- Feed queries now also reach the relays that the people you follow actually publish to (NIP-65
  write relays), not only the relays configured in Settings — less time spent waiting on a relay
  that never had a given author's notes in the first place.
- Like/reply/repost/zap counts for notes further down the feed are now fetched only once a note
  actually scrolls into view, instead of eagerly for the entire page. Combined with the relay
  routing above, pull-to-refresh and scrolling through the feed and notifications are both
  noticeably faster.

### Fixed

- A single relay hiccup while scrolling deep into the feed could permanently stop further notes
  from loading for the rest of that session. The feed now retries further back automatically
  before giving up, with a "Load more" button once it does — this is a partial fix, reaching the
  very end of the feed can still get stuck in some cases and needs further work.

## [0.5.16] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Pulling to refresh the feed or notifications could take much longer than it should: a single
  refresh fires off dozens of overlapping relay queries, and a couple of the public relays this
  app talks to (nostr.mom, offchain.pub) reject a connection's request outright once too many of
  its subscriptions are still open at the same time. Every relay's subscription used to stay
  "open" from that relay's point of view until the *entire* page's fetch had settled across every
  relay, even for the relay that had already answered in milliseconds — so a handful of slow
  relays kept otherwise-fast ones tied up long enough to trip that limit repeatedly on every
  refresh. Subscriptions now close the moment each relay actually answers, a rejected request now
  fails immediately instead of sitting through the full request timeout waiting for a reply that
  was never coming, and no more than 4 relay queries run at once app-wide. Confirmed via captured
  device logs and an isolated reproduction against the affected relays: rejections dropped to
  zero under identical traffic. A page still needs on the order of a hundred relay round trips in
  this fork's fully relay-only design, so refresh isn't instant, but it no longer wastes time on
  rejections it caused itself.

## [0.5.15] - 2026-09-14

### Removed

- The in-app Primal wallet is gone: no more custodial balance, deposits/withdrawals, the
  self-custodial Spark wallet option, promo-code redemption, or the ability to let another app
  spend from either wallet over Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC). Safely operating a real wallet isn't
  something this fork can commit to, so it's better removed cleanly than left half-working.
  **Zapping is unaffected** — it still builds a standard NIP-57 zap request and hands the invoice
  to whichever Lightning wallet app is installed on your phone, exactly as before.

### Fixed

- The notifications tab did a full refresh from relays every time it was opened, even seconds
  after the previous visit with nothing new to show. It now only does a full refresh when little
  or nothing is cached locally yet.
- The GIF picker in the note composer opened blank until you typed a search. Trending GIFs now
  load automatically as soon as it opens.
- Every direct-message send or fetch left a background task running for the rest of the app
  session, never cleaned up — a slow memory leak on accounts that use DMs a lot.
- An internal cache used to avoid re-checking Nostr address (NIP-05) verification kept growing for
  as long as the app ran, with nothing ever removed from it. It's now capped to a sane size.
- Live stream chat kept the *entire* message history for a broadcast in memory and reprocessed all
  of it on every new message, so long or popular streams could accumulate this without bound. Chat
  now keeps a rolling window of the most recent messages instead.
- Reconnecting to a remote signer app (e.g. Amber) more than once in the same app session could
  produce duplicate "new signer request" notifications; the underlying subscriptions now only ever
  start once per app session instead of stacking on every reconnect.

### Changed

- Reply threads could visibly stutter while scrolling long conversations: any single change
  anywhere in the thread (a like, a zap, anything) was rebuilding *every* visible reply card from
  scratch instead of only the one that actually changed. Scrolling should now feel noticeably
  smoother, especially in longer threads.
- Saving a page of fetched notes to the local cache ran one extra, unfiltered database query per
  note before saving it — a full feed page could mean dozens of redundant queries fired back to
  back. A page now saves with a single query regardless of how many notes it contains.
- Raised the local image/media cache limits (feed avatars, attachments, video thumbnails), so
  scrolling back up through a session causes fewer unnecessary re-downloads than before.

## [0.5.14] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Opening "who liked this" briefly showed "no likes yet" before the real list appeared. Likes and
  reposts were fetched at the same time but shared one loading flag; reposts (usually the shorter
  list) finishing first flipped it off for both tabs while the likes fetch was still in flight,
  making the still-empty list render as a genuine empty state until the real fetch caught up.
  Likes and reposts now each track their own loading state.
- The retry button on a "mentioned event not found" card looked like it did nothing: it did fetch
  and store the missing note, but the citing note's own feed row never got told to redraw (its
  live query deliberately does not watch that table, to avoid invalidating every open feed on
  every unrelated note fetch elsewhere in the app). The retry now updates the card directly once
  its target resolves, the same approach already used by the note editor's own retry.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Loading a page of the following feed used to make three relay round trips one after another:
  the notes themselves, then any quoted notes, then everyone's profile metadata. Quoted notes and
  profile metadata for the page's own authors now fetch at the same time instead of waiting on
  each other, and both skip anything already known from an earlier page in the same session
  (already-fetched profiles, already-stored quoted notes) instead of asking the relays again —
  the same request-avoiding pattern the notifications tab already used. Feed pages should now
  paint noticeably sooner, especially a following list with active posters who recur across pages.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-09-12

### Security

- Direct messages and private-thread replies could end up stored unencrypted on debug builds
  installed on real devices. The caching database shared its encryption on/off switch with the
  wallet and account databases, and those two turn it off on debug builds purely for easier local
  inspection; because the switch was a single flag shared by all three databases instead of being
  scoped per database, that debug convenience silently carried over to DM/private-reply content
  too. The caching database now uses its own always-on encryption path that nothing else can
  disable, structurally, regardless of what any other database's debug build does.
- The key that encrypts the local nsec/account store now requests hardware-backed StrongBox
  storage on devices that support it, matching the protection already used for the database
  encryption key. Falls back automatically on devices/algorithm combinations that advertise
  StrongBox but can't actually back it, as recommended by Android's own key-generation guidance.

### Fixed

- Pull-to-refresh on the feed occasionally reloaded only your own notes instead of your full
  following list, when the follow list hadn't finished loading yet from relays at the moment of
  refresh.
- Pull-to-refresh on notifications occasionally reloaded 15-day-old notifications instead of
  today's; tapping "mark all as read" then showed today's notifications again, but not fully
  updated.
- Mentioning a user, quoting a note, or attaching an image initially rendered as a raw
  `@npub1...`/`nevent1...` reference instead of the chosen display name or a proper embed, until
  the note was reloaded. Newly-published notes now resolve and render these immediately.
- A "failed to load more" banner on feeds and article lists existed in the code but was gated
  behind a developer flag that is permanently off in every real build, so pagination failures were
  silently invisible to every user. The banner (with its retry-relevant error message) now always
  shows when a page genuinely fails to load.

### Removed

- The crash reporter was a non-functional stub: it built a full crash report on every uncaught
  exception but only ever logged "upload is disabled" and discarded it. Removed rather than left
  as dead code that looked functional but wasn't.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The welcome screen no longer crashes on Android 8 and later while loading the app logo. It
  previously passed the API-specific adaptive launcher icon to Compose's `painterResource`, which
  only accepts raster images and VectorDrawables; the screen now uses the dedicated raster logo.
- The launcher icon is restored to the original LibreNostr squircle used through 0.5.6. The
  adaptive-icon experiment is removed because launchers supplied a black circular backing behind
  its transparent background, producing a black circle with a smaller squircle inside it.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The adaptive launcher icon now keeps LibreNostr's own squircle artwork on launchers that apply
  their own icon masks. Its artwork is carried by the foreground layer with a transparent
  background, preventing the launcher mask from turning the icon into a circle while retaining
  the correct full-size rendering.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- The launcher icon's foreground layer now fills almost the entire adaptive-icon canvas instead
  of being shrunk into the conservative safe zone, so on a squircle-masked launcher (the common
  case on Pixel-family and Material You launchers) it renders as a proper edge-to-edge squircle —
  the icon's own artwork, not a smaller icon floating inside a larger padded background. Checked
  under a squircle, a circle and a rounded-square mask; the bird stays fully intact under all
  three.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The adaptive launcher icon shipped in 0.5.7 replaced the crisp, original bird artwork with a
  pixel-extracted reconstruction (no vector source was available) that showed a visible grayish
  edge along the wing layers and a jagged notch on the smallest wing tip at real launcher size —
  a regression on every device, not just the ones the previous fix targeted. The foreground layer
  is now the original flat icon itself, cropped with a genuinely clean, zero-antialiasing cut
  (verified pixel by pixel) and scaled into the adaptive-icon safe zone, so it is pixel-identical
  to the original artwork rather than a reconstruction of it.
- The adaptive icon's background layer is now a vector drawable with explicit 108dp bounds instead
  of a plain gradient shape, which has no intrinsic size of its own; some launchers' icon caching
  and extraction paths size their render target from that value before drawing and could come out
  blank if it reports none.
- The Android 13+ themed-icon (monochrome) layer is now built from the app's existing status-bar
  silhouette asset instead of the same pixel extraction, removing the same edge artifacts there.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The launcher icon no longer gets shrunk onto a white background on launchers that enforce
  Material You-style adaptive icons (GrapheneOS's default launcher among them). The app shipped
  only legacy flat icon PNGs with no adaptive-icon declaration, so such a launcher synthesized its
  own padded, white-backed version rather than rendering the icon full-bleed. A proper adaptive
  icon is now declared: the bird glyph as its own layer on the icon's own purple gradient
  background, sized to the standard safe zone and verified against both circle and rounded-square
  masks, plus a monochrome layer for Android 13+ themed icons. `android:roundIcon` also pointed at
  the square icon instead of the round one; fixed alongside it.
- A note that quotes another note no longer gets stuck showing "Mentioned event not found"
  forever once its target is actually available. The "not found" classification was a one-time
  snapshot taken when the quoting note was first saved, never re-checked afterward — so the retry
  button really did fetch the missing note, but nothing ever told the quoting note about it. Any
  note persisted anywhere in the app now heals every other stored citation of it, not only the
  ones in that same fetch, and does so without disturbing the citing note's other embeds.
- The Italian "Report Content" action in note, article and live stream menus read as "Contenuto
  della relazione" (a mistranslation of "report" as a noun) instead of the intended action;
  corrected to "Segnala contenuto", matching "Segnala utente" right next to it.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- The recipient of a NIP-17 direct message or private reply now actually receives it. Relay
  resolution was asymmetric between the two sides of a send: a sender resolving a remote
  recipient with no kind-10050 fell back to the public bootstrap pool, while that recipient
  polling their own inbox stopped at their own configured relays and never checked the bootstrap
  pool at all — the two sides agreed on nothing, so the wrap was delivered exactly where nobody
  was listening. Inbox polling now reads the union of every relay a sender could plausibly have
  used, and an account's own kind-10050 is announced on first poll rather than only after a send.
- The Messages badge unread count is no longer hardcoded to zero. It is now derived from what
  actually arrived past the last known message, and opening a conversation clears it locally.
- A private reply notification now shows the lock indicator and opens the thread it answers when
  tapped, instead of missing both because the notification screen built its note preview by hand
  and dropped the fields that carry them.
- Private-reply sender profiles are now cached the same way direct-message senders already were,
  so a private-reply notification shows the sender's name instead of a raw npub.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Private replies sent over NIP-17 now appear in their own thread instead of being sorted above
  the conversation root: the thread's topological sort reads the gift-wrapped reply's normalized
  root/parent relationship directly, not only public NIP-10 tags, which a private reply never
  carries.
- The recipient of a private reply now gets a local notification for it — nothing else can, since
  the reply exists only inside an encrypted Gift Wrap and no relay ever serves one. Tapping the
  notification opens the thread the reply belongs to.
- The sent-reply lock indicator on a private reply's note card is now an icon and label together,
  matching Amethyst/Damus, instead of label text alone.
- NIP-17 relay resolution for both direct messages and private replies now follows the recipient's
  kind-10050 inbox, then their NIP-65 read relays, then a bootstrap pool, mirroring Amethyst's own
  fallback policy. Previously a missing kind-10050 could make an otherwise deliverable message fail
  outright.
- A legacy NIP-04 direct message (the fallback used when a contact has no kind-10050) is now also
  published to the recipient's own relays, not only the sender's write relays, so accounts with
  disjoint relay sets can actually reach each other.
- A private reply naming only a thread root (a NIP-10-legal shape, and the one Amethyst produces
  most often) is no longer silently dropped; a duplicate or malformed marker no longer discards an
  otherwise valid reply either.
- Announcing an account's own NIP-17 DM relay list no longer runs before every send and can no
  longer make an otherwise deliverable message fail; it is now a best-effort step after delivery.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Private replies are now invoked directly from a thread's reply toolbar via a lock icon, instead
  of being hidden in a note overflow menu. The recipient picker accepts either a searched username
  or an `npub`; only that selected account can decrypt the resulting NIP-17 reply.
- Normal thread replies remain public by default. Private delivery is enabled only after the lock
  action and recipient selection, and can be switched back off before publishing.
- NIP-17 conversations now continue to refresh and send through the compatible legacy path when a
  contact has not yet published a kind-10050 DM relay list, rather than failing the whole inbox.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Modern private messages now use the NIP-17 pipeline: NIP-44 encryption, NIP-59 seals and Gift
  Wraps, recipient kind-10050 DM relay discovery, a sender copy, and a central inbox subscription.
  Newly sent messages no longer create legacy NIP-04 events.
- Public threads support private replies to either a public note or an already-private reply. The
  encrypted root and parent markers are normalized into the existing thread tree only after
  decryption, persisted in encrypted local storage, and shown to authorized users with a small
  private badge. Gift Wraps reveal neither the thread relationship nor the plaintext to relays.

### Fixed

- Scrolling the Home feed now moves the complete LibreNostr header off-screen and gives its full
  height back to the timeline; scrolling in the opposite direction restores it.
- The center compose (`+`) action remains attached to the bottom navigation while the Home header
  is collapsed.
- Zap notifications now display the amount for every supported zap-notification grouping.
- Video attachments can decode and display an actual preview frame when no explicit thumbnail is
  supplied, instead of leaving a flat grey placeholder.
- Setting descriptions use readable foreground colours across the Dark Pixel, Dark Green Pixel,
  Dark Fire, Light Pixel, Green Pixel, and Fire Light themes.
- The expanded Tor settings section no longer leaves an oversized black area below its content.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- A thread with an unusually long chain of nested replies could crash the app outright — the
  code that lays out the reply tree walked one level at a time recursively, and a deep enough
  chain overflowed the call stack. Rewritten to walk iteratively instead, with no protocol-level
  depth limit.
- Deeply nested replies no longer push the note itself further and further off the edge of the
  screen — indentation now caps out after a handful of levels while the actual nesting is still
  tracked correctly underneath.
- A reply whose parent note this app doesn't have used to render at the same visual weight as a
  confirmed direct reply to what you opened, with nothing distinguishing the two. It now draws
  with a fainter connector instead, so it's still there — never hidden — but doesn't read as more
  certain than it actually is.
- Reply ordering could be unstable when two replies shared the exact same timestamp (common when
  several relays hand back events for the same second); ties now resolve the same way every time.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Typing `@name` to mention someone could take several seconds before any
  result appeared. The search first tries a relay-side NIP-50 query, then
  fell back to a second, unfiltered query only if that failed — but the two
  ran strictly one after the other, so on a relay pool without NIP-50
  support (the common case here) every search paid both queries' full
  timeouts back to back. They now run at the same time; the fallback is
  cancelled the moment the NIP-50 query alone comes back with something, so
  a relay that does support NIP-50 is unaffected.
- A note that quoted or mentioned another note sometimes showed "Mentioned
  event not found" even though the referenced note existed and rendered
  fine elsewhere (the home feed, an opened thread). Search results,
  notifications, and article comments never fetched the notes a note
  quoted, only the note itself — now they do, matching the feed and
  thread screens. The "not found" card also has a working retry button
  now, instead of being a dead end after a single failed attempt.
- Some quoted or mentioned notes rendered as raw `nostr:nevent1…` text
  instead of a card — a reference that matched the expected format but
  failed to decode (a corrupted copy-paste, a checksum another client
  mangled) used to be silently dropped with no trace, leaving the literal
  text on screen forever. It's now shown as an unresolved-reference card
  like any other note that can't be found, instead of leaking as text.
- Video attachments almost never showed a preview frame, even when the
  note carried one. The video's own metadata tag can include a preview
  image, but it was never read — only Primal's own (now-unused) preview
  service was checked, so it fell back to nothing.
- The app sometimes loaded only your own notes and only your own
  notifications for a while after a cold start — notifications now retry
  a genuinely empty first response instead of treating it as "no
  notifications, ever," matching a fix already in place for the note feed.
- Zap notifications showed the sats-zapped amount only for a direct zap on
  your own post — a zap on a post you were mentioned in, or on a post that
  mentioned one of yours, showed the zap icon with no amount at all.
- The feed could visibly jump mid-scroll as more notes loaded. A background
  refresh of like/repost/zap counts for the newly-loaded page could land
  after you'd already scrolled further, and the resulting reflow used the
  scroll position's on-screen index rather than the note actually under
  it — turning off index-based placeholders in favor of per-note identity
  fixes the reflow to track the right note instead of the wrong index.
- On the Dark Pixel theme, the follow/unfollow button on a profile could be
  partly hidden behind the avatar once you already followed that person —
  the button's monospace font ran wider than the space reserved for it.

### Removed

- On-device note translation. It added a large, always-on cost to every
  build (native toolchain, a ~70-language detection model) for a feature
  that saw essentially no use. The code isn't gone, just disconnected from
  the build, in case it's worth reviving in a more selective form later.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Tor support via Orbot**: a new "Tor" entry in Settings routes relay
  connections, zap/lightning requests, media uploads, image loading, media
  downloads, video/audio playback, and embedded link previews through
  Orbot's SOCKS proxy instead of connecting directly. Off by default; the
  SOCKS port is configurable (defaults to Orbot's own default, 9050). If
  Orbot isn't detected as installed, the settings screen says so plainly.
  There is no fallback to a direct connection if the proxy isn't reachable
  — connections fail instead of silently leaking outside Tor. The setting
  takes effect on the next full restart, not immediately, since every
  network client in the app is a long-lived singleton built once at
  startup; the app is explicit about this rather than pretending otherwise.
  A new onboarding step (shown once, for both new and existing accounts)
  explains the feature and links to Orbot on Zapstore.

### Fixed

- Tapping the zap button could crash the app outright. The zap sheet's
  amount-preset grid was a `LazyVerticalGrid` sitting inside a `Column`
  that scrolls to make room for the keyboard — a lazy grid inside a
  scrollable container with no bounded height is disallowed and threw
  immediately. Replaced with a plain, non-lazy grid; the preset count is
  small and fixed, so there was never anything to virtualize.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- A redesigned home header — LibreNostr wordmark and tagline, an integrated
  search bar, a swipeable avatar — and a floating, pill-shaped navigation
  dock, replacing the previous Primal-styled top bar and bottom navigation.
  The biggest visual departure from Primal yet.
- Two more themes, Green Pixel and Dark Green Pixel, joining the existing
  six; the theme picker is now a 4×2 grid instead of 3×3 with a gap.
- A second button next to the publish countdown's "Don't send" — "I've read
  it, send now" — for skipping the rest of the wait once you've actually
  reviewed the note, translated into every supported language.
- Zap notifications now show the sat amount as its own bold, colored badge
  instead of leaving it buried inside the sentence text.

### Changed

- The navigation dock no longer has a separate account button — tapping the
  avatar already in the home header does the same thing, so this was a
  redundant second way to reach it. The dock's five remaining buttons
  (Feeds, Messages, compose, Notifications, Settings) are now evenly spaced
  with compose in the middle, instead of six unevenly packed ones.
- The home header no longer shows a hamburger icon or a feed-name chip
  under the search bar for opening the algorithm picker. Onboarding already
  explains that a swipe does this, so both buttons duplicated a gesture
  that was already the primary way in.

### Fixed

- A handful of small regressions from the redesign above: an off-center
  theme swatch icon, a hardcoded English "Profile" label where every other
  string is translated, and a navigation-bar height constant that no longer
  matched the dock's real height, which could misalign layout sitting below
  it (e.g. the wallet dashboard footer).
- A broad Italian mistranslation pass: "account" no longer shows as "conti"
  (bank accounts) anywhere, and dozens of other terms across feeds, mute/
  follow, wallet, sats, Lightning, reporting, and search are now consistent
  with what is, at its core, a social app.
- The same class of corruption that caused the Italian bugs above turned
  out to affect nearly every other language: `nsec`/`npub` replaced with
  unrelated words, login and logout both reading as "Sign", "backed up"
  mistranslated as "supported" in the wallet's fund-loss warning, and
  "share" mistranslated as a stock/equity term instead of the social
  action. Fixed across Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, Spanish,
  Estonian, French, Croatian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Maltese,
  Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, and
  Chinese — around 140 strings in total.
- Japanese was corrupted far beyond a few bad strings: dozens of unrelated
  buttons and labels throughout the app had all been collapsed onto the
  same handful of wrong phrases (every "Retry", "Close", and "Done" button
  in the app, among others, showed the same unrelated word). Fully
  retranslated — over 130 strings corrected.

### Removed

- Irish (`ga`) is no longer a supported UI language. Its translation was
  corrupted beyond a reasonable patch — the app's own name, `nsec`/`npub`,
  and dozens of unrelated buttons were all random, unrelated phrases. It
  will come back once someone can redo it properly.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Four new themes**: Dark Pixel, Light Pixel, Fire, and Fire Light join
  Midnight and Ice — six in total, shown in a grid with each theme's own
  name and color swatch instead of a plain "Dark"/"Light" pair. The two
  Pixel themes also use a different typeface (Fira Mono) and sharper
  corners, the first themes here to vary anything beyond color.

### Fixed

- The feed could show only your own notes after a cold start, sometimes
  needing the app force-closed and reopened to recover. A relay query
  racing ahead of the app's own relay connections on startup returned an
  empty follow list, and that empty result got cached for 5 minutes —
  turning a one-off timing issue into a long-lived one. A fresh feed load
  now retries instead of trusting a remembered "you follow nobody" answer.
- Scrolling a feed to load more notes could still make it visibly jump —
  the 0.3.0 fix for this addressed one of two places that were forcing a
  reload on every page, not both.
- The zap comment field could end up hidden behind the on-screen keyboard,
  with no way to see what you were typing. The zap sheet's amount-preset
  grid is also a bit more compact now.
- Switching between Home, Messages, Notifications, and Settings used
  inconsistent, sometimes directionless animations — tabs now consistently
  slide toward whichever side they actually sit on.
- Several Italian strings translated in 0.3.0 didn't make sense in context
  ("account" as "conto" — a bank account, "muted" as "morto" — dead,
  "note" as "biglietto" — a ticket, among others).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-06

Note translation is now fully on-device — no server, no configuration,
nothing ever leaves your phone.

### Changed

- **Note translation no longer uses a remote LibreTranslate server.** The
  "Translate" action introduced in 0.3.0 now runs entirely on-device via
  Bergamot Translator (Mozilla's own production NMT engine — the same one
  built into Firefox) with real neural translation models, covering every
  EU official language plus Chinese, Japanese, and Maltese in both
  directions (Irish has no published model anywhere, so it isn't
  supported). Models are small (mostly 14-18MB per language pair) and
  download on demand, with an explicit confirmation showing the real size
  and an on-device/offline disclosure before anything is fetched — never
  bundled into the app itself. "Translate notes" is on by default now that
  there's no server address or API key to configure; the now-pointless
  server URL and API key fields have been removed from Settings > Content
  Display.
- Raised the minimum supported Android version from 9.0 to Pie (API 28,
  Android 9) — the on-device translation engine's `iconv` usage requires it.
- Release APKs are now built for `arm64-v8a` only (previously also
  `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64`). A real 32-bit-only phone isn't a realistic
  target any more, and native x86_64 Android phones are effectively
  nonexistent today — the rare x86 devices (Chromebooks) already run arm64
  apps through their own translation layer.

### Fixed

- Translating several notes in a scrolling session could grow the app's
  memory use without bound until it ran out of memory and crashed —
  language detection was loading its full offline model independently for
  every note instead of once, shared.
- Scrolling a note out of view while it was translating (or downloading a
  language pack) silently abandoned the operation — the spinner just kept
  spinning forever, with no error and no result even if you scrolled back.
  Translation now runs independently of what's on screen, so it keeps
  going, and finishes, regardless.
- Translation could take upwards of 15-20 seconds per note due to two
  compounding issues: the debug build of the native engine ran unoptimized
  (a side effect of how Android normally compiles debug builds), and the
  one-time language-detection setup was doing several times more work than
  it needed to. Both are fixed — a typical translation now takes about two
  seconds.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-05

A privacy/security pass across the codebase, prompted by an audit looking
specifically for data leaks and unnecessary attack surface.

### Fixed

- **The media-upload HTTP client could write a signed auth header to disk.**
  Enabling the in-app diagnostic logging (off by default, Settings) and then
  uploading a photo or video wrote the request's `Authorization` header — a
  signed Nostr event carrying your pubkey — into the exportable app logs.
  Anyone using "Share Logs" to send diagnostics to support would have sent
  that along with it, unknowingly. Logging is now fully disabled for that
  client, matching every other network client in the app; an additional,
  separate line of code that printed the same headers unconditionally
  (independent of the logging setting) was removed outright.
- **The note-translate server address wasn't required to be HTTPS.** The
  server URL you configure in Settings > Content Display > Translate notes
  is now checked before every request; a plain `http://` address is refused
  rather than relying on Android's network security config to catch it as
  a side effect. Note text should never leave the device other than
  encrypted, on purpose, not by accident of a different setting.
- Removed an unused, unwired no-op logger class left over from an earlier
  logging setup — dead code, no behavior change.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-05

The app now speaks 27 languages, and notes in a language you don't understand
can be translated with a tap.

### Added

- **Translate notes.** A small "Translate" action can now appear below a
  note's text — styled and placed apart from the reply/zap/like/repost row
  so it reads as something the app is offering, not something the author
  wrote. Tapping it calls a LibreTranslate-compatible server (self-hosted or
  any instance you trust) and shows the result in place, with a
  "Translated · See original" toggle to switch back. Off by default: enable
  it and set your server's URL under Settings > Content Display >
  Translate notes. No default third-party server is bundled — note text is
  only ever sent somewhere you've explicitly configured.
- **Full translation into 26 languages.** Every EU official language, plus
  Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, joins English as a complete UI translation
  (24 via local, offline neural machine translation; Croatian and Maltese,
  which that engine doesn't support, via a second offline model). Every
  translated string was checked for correct placeholder handling, valid
  XML, and consistent phrasing with the rest of each locale; a number of
  machine-translation artifacts (corrupted formatting placeholders,
  duplicated words on short labels, one flipped negation, one truncated
  sentence) were caught and hand-fixed along the way.

### Fixed

- **Scrolling down a feed could make it randomly jump or reload.** Loading
  more notes at the bottom of a feed also triggers a fetch of their
  engagement counts (likes, zaps, reposts) from relays; that fetch used to
  invalidate and reload the *entire* already-scrolled feed once it
  finished, however long that took. On a slow relay, this landed well into
  a later scroll and looked like the feed refreshing itself for no reason.
  The reload is now scoped to actual refreshes (pull-to-refresh, opening
  the feed) — scrolling for more notes no longer touches what's already on
  screen.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-09-04

Four small polish fixes from a real-device pass: a slightly clipped splash
logo, a jarring tab switch, a missing swipe gesture, and a dead Home button.

### Fixed

- **The splash screen logo was clipped in a corner.** The icon's artwork
  extended past the safe zone the system's splash screen uses when masking
  and scaling it, clipping a sliver off one edge. Re-centered with proper
  margin.
- **Switching from Messages to Notifications flashed and rebuilt the whole
  screen.** Messages lives in its own navigation destination rather than
  the app's in-place tab system, so switching tabs was popping back to a
  fully torn-down screen and replaying a "returning from a detail screen"
  scale animation. That transition is now instant, matching every other
  tab.
- **The DM Follows/Other tabs only responded to taps, not swipes.** Rebuilt
  on a `HorizontalPager` (the same pattern already used elsewhere in the
  app), so swiping left/right now switches between them, with the tab
  indicator and underlying data following along either way.
- **Tapping Home from the Profile screen did nothing.** The persistent
  bottom bar mislabeled Feeds as the active tab while viewing a profile,
  so tapping Home read as "you're already here" and silently no-opped.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-09-03

The new Accounts entry in Settings only offered to add another account,
with no way to see which accounts were already signed in, switch between
them, or sign out — a second account you added looked like it had replaced
the first, since there was nowhere to find it again.

### Fixed

- **Settings > Accounts now shows account switching and logout, not just
  "add account."** The app already had a fully working account switcher —
  list of signed-in accounts, tap to switch, an edit mode with a logout
  button, add/create actions — but it only lived behind a small avatar
  icon tucked next to the account name in the drawer, easy to miss.
  Settings now opens that same switcher directly, so a second account
  doesn't feel like it swallowed the first.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-09-03

A quoted note that wasn't already cached for some other reason showed
"Mentioned event not found", the new Accounts entry in Settings had nothing
inside it, and a bunker connection could leak a socket if you backed out
mid-login.

### Fixed

- **Quoted notes often rendered as "Mentioned event not found."** A note
  quoting another note — via a `nostr:note1…`/`nevent1…` reference or a
  NIP-18 `q` tag — used to only render correctly by coincidence, if the
  quoted note happened to already be cached from something else. The field
  that used to carry it was Primal's centralized cache server's job, and
  was never replaced with a relay fetch after the fork. The thread screen
  and the main feed now ask relays for a quoted note (and its author's
  profile) whenever it's missing.
- **The new "Accounts" entry in Settings showed nothing when tapped.**
  Settings rows render their content inline rather than navigating away,
  and this one had no inline content wired up, so it just expanded to an
  empty box. It now shows the "Add an existing account" action.
- **A bunker (NIP-46) account could be asked to approve leftover event
  kinds it should never see**, the same "leftover cache/wallet kind" set
  Amber accounts were already shielded from — the filter only checked for
  Amber, not for a bunker connection.
- **A cancelled bunker connection (backing out mid-login, or cancelling a
  pending publish) could leak an open socket.** The connection's cleanup
  ran as a normal step after the work, not in a `finally`, so a
  cancellation skipped it.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-09-03

Adding a second account was only possible from a switcher tucked inside the
drawer; there was also no way at all to sign in with a remote signer
("bunker") instead of a raw key or Amber.

### Added

- **An "Accounts" entry in Settings for adding another account.** Reuses the
  existing sign-in screen — nsec/npub paste or Amber — which was already
  safe to use for a second account (it never touches an already-logged-in
  one). As before, multiple accounts on this device share the same relay
  connections and local database: this is convenience, not identity
  separation, and a relay can trivially tell they belong to the same
  device. Keeping two identities genuinely unlinkable is a separate,
  larger piece of work, not something this screen provides.
- **Sign in with a bunker (NIP-46 remote signer).** Paste a `bunker://`
  connection string from Amber's bunker mode, nsec.app, or any other NIP-46
  signer to add an account without ever handing LibreNostr your private
  key. Each note published from that account is signed by a round trip to
  the bunker over its own relay channel, using a throwaway keypair
  generated just for that connection — never the account's real key.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-03

Two accounts on the same device already shared their relay connections and
local cache; the cleanup and search-feed code paths had not caught up with
that.

### Fixed

- **Logging out one account discarded shared cache other logged-in accounts
  were still using.** The coordinator's follow-list cache and hot event
  layer are one process-wide instance, shared by every account signed in on
  the device — logging out account A used to wipe both unconditionally,
  even with account B still logged in and relying on them. It is now reset
  only when the account being removed was the last one signed in.
- **Advanced search's `myfollows` scope asked relays directly instead of
  going through the fetch coordinator.** This was the case named when the
  coordinator was introduced — the note feed, article feed and advanced
  search all want the same follow list, often within the same burst of tab
  loads — but this call site was never actually wired to it. It now shares
  the same coalesced, briefly-cached request as everything else.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-03

Proofreading a note before it went out meant trusting the countdown alone,
and tagging someone by name only worked if a relay happened to answer.

### Added

- **The publish countdown now shows a preview of the note.** The last few
  seconds before a note goes out were a bare timer with no way to see what
  was actually about to be published. The countdown screen now renders the
  note's text and any attached image or GIF the same way a published note
  would look, so a mistake is caught by reading it, not by guessing.
- **Mention search now checks profiles you already have before asking a
  relay.** Typing `@` followed by a name only searched relays — a NIP-50
  `search` filter if the relay supported it, otherwise a scan of the last
  500 arbitrary profile events, meaning a followed or previously-seen
  profile could still fail to show up. Profiles already cached locally now
  match instantly by name prefix, offline included; a relay is only asked
  to fill whatever the local cache didn't already cover.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-02

A privacy-preserving relay stopped handing back direct messages at all, and
thread replies rendered as one flat pile regardless of who was actually
answering whom.

### Fixed

- **A relay's NIP-42 challenge for direct messages was never answered.**
  Some relays require authentication before returning kind-4 events
  specifically, so nobody can read your DMs off them without proving who
  they are — a real relay-side privacy protection. LibreNostr's socket
  layer already had the wire message to answer that challenge, unused
  since the day it was written; nothing upstream ever called it, so every
  relay enforcing this policy silently returned nothing, forever, for
  every conversation whose only copy lived there. Every relay pool now
  answers a challenge with a signed event when it has a signer — only the
  account's own relay pool gets one, never the fallback pool or the
  wallet-connect pool, since authenticating on either would disclose more
  than that relationship calls for.
- **A reply to a reply rendered at the same rank as every other reply.**
  Everything after the opened note in a thread was sorted by timestamp
  alone, in two flat buckets, with no notion of who was actually replying
  to whom. A NIP-10 tag names a reply's parent exactly, and the thread
  screen was not using it. Replies are now walked into a proper tree from
  that tag, and the screen draws one vertical bar per level — a reply to a
  reply visibly nests under the comment it answers instead of sitting at
  the same rank as an unrelated reply that merely arrived nearby in time.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-02

Two follow-up fixes to the Follows/Requests split shipped in 0.2.0, found
by using the app rather than by reading the code.

### Fixed

- **A reply landing in the same relay page as the stranger's first message
  was still filed as a request.** The classification read who you had
  written to from the local database, and the page that just discovered
  the conversation had not been saved yet — persisting happens after
  classification runs. A conversation whose reply and first-seen message
  arrive together got judged before its own evidence existed, and nothing
  would ever revisit it: a quiet conversation's events do not reappear in
  a later sync once they fall outside its window. Fixed by folding the
  page's own messages into the same check, so a reply counts the moment
  it is seen instead of waiting for a future sync to notice it already
  happened.
- **A conversation misclassified before the fix existed stayed that way
  forever**, even carrying a reply the database had held all along. A
  stored conversation's relation only changed when its events reappeared
  in a fresh relay fetch — which an old, quiet conversation never does, so
  its very first classification became permanent. Every sync now sweeps
  every stored conversation against current local data once, correcting
  rows like this without needing anything back from the relays.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

A request coordinator so the app stops asking relays the same question
twice, and three bugs it turned up along the way: direct messages showing
raw npubs, profile tabs that never loaded, and a Requests/Follows split
that was not actually splitting anything.

### Added

- **A fetch coordinator sits between every repository and the relays.**
  Before this, each repository asked on its own and nothing knew what
  anything else had already requested. The active user's follow list was
  fetched independently by the note feed, the article feed, advanced
  search, explore and the profile screen — five requests for one kind-3
  event, all at once on app start. Profile metadata was worse: two screens
  showing the same author each asked for kind 0 separately, and the
  profile screen bypassed the existing cache entirely. A concurrent request
  for something already in flight now attaches to it instead of opening a
  second one; two screens asking for overlapping sets of authors or notes
  now share whatever overlaps and only ask separately for what does not.
  The follow list additionally gets a short time-to-live, since the
  screens that want it open seconds apart rather than at the same instant.

### Fixed

- **Feeds, notifications and DMs lost events past about four relays.** The
  incoming socket flow was unbuffered, so one slow collector blocked the
  read loop for every relay behind it, and a query could finish on the
  first EOSE while other relays still had events in flight. Buffered now,
  and a query waits for a quorum instead of a winner.
- **Direct messages showed a raw npub instead of a name for many
  conversations.** A relay hands back kind-4 events and nothing else, so
  the conversation list never asked for the participants' profiles — a
  name appeared only when another screen happened to have fetched that
  profile first. The people you have exchanged messages with are the last
  ones who should read as a hex string.
- **A profile's Notes and Replies tabs never loaded**, showing "unable to
  load content" every time. Somebody's own notes are a plain author filter
  a relay can answer directly, but the feed mediator only recognised
  following feeds and follow sets, so a profile tab fell through to the
  centralized API this build doesn't have. Dead since the relay migration,
  not introduced by this release.
- **The Requests and Follows message tabs showed the same conversations.**
  Every conversation was written under one relation regardless of which
  tab it was fetched for, and the list query ignored the column besides.
  A relation is now decided locally, the way Amethyst does it: a
  conversation counts as accepted if you follow the other person or you
  have written back to them, and everything else is a request. Answering
  somebody is what accepts them, so a request does not sit there forever.
- **Follow/unfollow loops filled the notifications tab.** A follow list is
  republished in full on every change, so an account cycling follow and
  unfollow emits a new event id each time; one account produced seven
  identical "followed you" rows inside a minute. Follows are now keyed by
  who did it and what day, and are grouped per day in the notifications
  list itself rather than only until the tab is opened.
- One failed profile-metadata request used to leave an author rendered as
  a raw npub for the rest of the session, because the request was marked
  done before anything came back. It is released and asked again now.

### Changed

- **A live note arriving no longer re-fetches the whole feed.** The
  refresh triggered by the live subscription asked for a full page across
  the entire follow list on every burst; it now asks the relays only for
  what is newer than the newest note already held, with an inclusive
  boundary so a note sharing a timestamp with it is not silently dropped.
- **Note interaction counts and DM-referenced profiles are shared through
  the coordinator.** Likes, replies, reposts and zaps for a note were
  re-fetched by every feed that displayed it; profiles referenced inside a
  conversation sat outside every existing dedupe. Both now coalesce with
  whatever else is already asking.
- Settings > Notifications gained a "Show new followers" switch, for
  turning follow notifications off entirely.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-01

Reliability with more than a handful of relays, a session that fetches before
you go looking, and a notifications tab that stops shouting.

### Added

- **A countdown before a note goes out.** Posting holds the note for a few
  seconds behind a countdown that can be tapped to call it off, because a note
  published to relays is effectively permanent. Configurable in
  Settings > Content display: a switch, and a slider from one to seven seconds.
  Replies go out immediately unless asked otherwise, since they are usually
  short and deliberate.
- **Notifications and direct messages are fetched at session start**, per
  account and cancelled on a switch. They used to be fetched only by their own
  paging mediators, which run when their tab is first shown, so the unread dot
  could not appear until you had already gone looking.
- **Older direct messages are pulled in on start.** The conversation request
  sent no limit and no `until`, so whatever a relay chose to return was the
  whole of local DM history and nothing would ever go back for the rest. It now
  walks backwards a few pages, stopping when a page comes back short.
- **A fourth onboarding screen** naming the two gestures that are otherwise
  undiscoverable: drag right from the middle of Home for the algorithm picker,
  drag left for the long-form reader.
- **Settings > Notifications > Show new followers**, to keep follows out of the
  notifications feed entirely. A follow is the one notification that carries
  nothing to read, and a bot loop can bury everything else.

### Fixed

- **Feeds, notifications and DMs lost events once the pool grew past about four
  relays.** The incoming socket flow was unbuffered, so a slow collector blocked
  the read loop for every relay behind it, and a query could finish on the first
  EOSE while other relays still had events in flight. The flow is buffered, the
  read loop no longer sleeps before EOSE, and a query now waits for a quorum
  rather than for whoever answers first.
- **Follow and unfollow loops filled the notifications tab.** A follow list is
  republished in full on every change, so accounts that follow and unfollow
  repeatedly emitted a new event id each cycle; keying rows by event id turned
  one account into seven identical rows inside a minute. Follows are keyed by
  who did it and on what day now.
- **Follows were grouped per day only until the tab was opened.** The seen feed
  is paged and mapped rows one to one, so marking everything seen brought every
  follow back as its own row. The grouping happens in the query now, where a
  page boundary cannot split a day, and the count is of people rather than of
  events.
- **One failed profile request left an author as a raw npub for the rest of the
  session.** Metadata requests were marked as done before knowing whether
  anything came back, and nothing would ask a second time.

### Changed

- **The default relay set was rebuilt by measurement.** Every candidate was
  asked for its NIP-11 document and then opened for a real REQ; the ones that
  answered with events and an EOSE on repeated attempts were kept.
  `relay.nostr.band` and `nostr.wine` were dropped from the defaults — the first
  answered nothing unauthenticated, the second requires payment and restricted
  writes; it is still offered during onboarding, unticked. `purplepag.es` moved
  to metadata-only, where it is unusually good and where it stops costing a
  round trip in note queries. Nothing is ticked by default: a pre-ticked list
  reads like an endorsement.
- **The event cache gained an in-memory hot layer and is now shared.** A note
  recurring across feed pages, a thread and a notification preview was read from
  SQLite and parsed from its raw JSON every time — about 378us per lookup of 40
  ids, against about 15us once hot. The cache was also constructed per
  repository and per paging mediator while being described as session-scoped, so
  every notifications tab started empty and re-asked the relays for authors the
  feed had already resolved. There is one instance now.
- The manual feed-refresh button is gone; the live subscription and the
  five-minute refresh underneath it make it redundant.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-01

Speed: fewer round trips, nothing re-downloaded, and a live subscription in
place of polling.

### Changed

- **New notes arrive over a live subscription instead of a 30-second poll.** The
  feed used to ask the relays for a fresh snapshot every thirty seconds whether
  or not anything had happened, so a new note appeared somewhere between
  instantly and half a minute late and the request went out either way. It now
  opens a live REQ scoped to the same authors as the feed, carrying only what is
  published from that moment on. The delay drops to about a second and nothing is
  sent while nothing happens. A five-minute refresh stays underneath, because a
  subscription can die quietly and a feed that silently stops updating is worse
  than one that updates late.
- **Events and profiles already in the database are no longer re-requested.** A
  thread's ancestors and the notes a notification points at are usually already
  stored by the feed; Nostr events are immutable and content-addressed, so a
  locally held id is the same event. Profile metadata is deduplicated per session
  rather than permanently, so a changed display name still comes through.
- **A full page no longer waits for the slowest relay.** Every query paid a grace
  period after the first EOSE and, when that EOSE carried no events, waited for
  the slowest relay up to the full timeout — even when the first relay had
  already delivered everything asked for. The early exit is gated on a *full*
  page, never a partial one, so a fast relay with a single event still cannot
  hide the rest of the network.
- **The follow list is no longer refetched before every page**, and author
  chunks are wider with more in flight, which brings the common case down to one
  sequential wave instead of two.

### Fixed

- Opening a reply from the notification list walked the ancestor chain one relay
  round trip at a time, up to five, then made three or four more in sequence.
  NIP-10 already names a reply's root and parent in its `e` tags, so the whole
  ancestor set fits in one filter: ten sequential round trips become three, and
  the first is the opened note together with its replies.
- A tagged user rendered as an ellipsized npub instead of the name they chose.
  The feed and thread fetchers requested metadata only for the authors of the
  events they loaded, never for the profiles mentioned inside them.
- Follow notifications were grouped under a single key that covered every follow
  the account had ever received. They are bucketed by day now.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-31

Notifications, Reads scoping, highlights and external-signer permissions.

### Fixed

- **Notifications were slow and returned a truncated page.** A Nostr filter takes
  a list of kinds, so one REQ is enough; the fetcher issued five — replies,
  reposts, reactions, zaps, follow lists — and each fanned out to both relay
  pools, so opening the tab cost ten pool queries with their own EOSE grace and
  timeouts. The split also truncated the result: every kind got the full `limit`
  independently and the union was cut back to `limit`, so a page was whichever
  kind happened to be busiest and the rest fell off the end. Each tab now
  requests only the kinds it can display, and referenced notes and actor
  metadata are fetched in parallel instead of chained.
- **Notification paging stopped after one page** on sparse tabs, because the end
  of the list was decided by the group-filtered row count rather than by what the
  relays returned.
- **Zaps were credited to the wrong person.** A NIP-57 receipt is signed by the
  recipient's LNURL server, not by the zapper; the sender is the author of the
  kind 9734 request embedded in the `description` tag.
- **Long-form Reads pulled from the global firehose.** The author list was passed
  as "no constraint" when empty, which happened for topic feeds, search feeds and
  any unrecognised spec — and the public long-form firehose is mostly spam. Every
  query is now scoped to an explicit author set: the user's follows, widened once
  to the follows of those follows when follows alone cannot fill a page, capped
  at 1000 authors because relays reject very large filter arrays. When no scope
  can be resolved the feed returns empty instead of falling back to global.
- **Topic Reads queried the wrong tag**, putting the hashtag in `#e` (event ids)
  instead of `#t`.
- **NIP-84 highlights never loaded.** The article fetch and the highlights fetch
  ran sequentially inside one `try` that caught only `NetworkException`, so any
  failure of the first skipped the second. They now run in parallel and each
  handles its own failure.
- **Highlights could not be signed by an external signer.** The notary gated
  signer requests on a kind allowlist that omitted 9802, so a highlight was
  rejected locally and Amber was never asked; polls, reports and stream mute
  lists were blocked the same way. Separately, the NIP-55 connect request asked
  for `sign_event` on kind 1 only, so every other kind prompted on each use. Both
  now derive from a single list, and the connect request also asks for nip44
  encrypt/decrypt and decrypt_zap_event.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-31

De-Googled build, Primal Premium removed, and image metadata stripped before
upload.

> **This release is signed with a new key.** The previous certificate carried a
> personal name in its subject; it has been retired in favour of a pseudonymous
> one (`CN=Lwb89dev, O=LibreNostr`). Android refuses to upgrade an installed app
> across a signing-key change, so **0.1.0 and 0.1.1 must be uninstalled before
> installing 0.1.2**. Uninstalling clears local app data, including any key
> stored on the device — back up your nsec first. The 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 APK assets
> have been withdrawn.

### Added

- Image metadata is stripped before an upload leaves the device. A photo from a
  camera carries EXIF with GPS coordinates, capture time, device make/model and
  often the owner's name; all of it was previously published to the Blossom
  server alongside the picture. JPEG loses APP1 (Exif/XMP), APP13
  (Photoshop/IPTC) and COM; PNG loses eXIf and the textual and tIME chunks;
  WebP loses EXIF and XMP. Colour and rendering segments are kept, pixel data is
  copied verbatim so there is no re-encoding, and video streams through
  untouched.
- A long-form reads destination with its own navigation glyph.

### Removed

- **Google.** The `google` product flavor and everything that fed it: Play
  Billing, ML Kit barcode scanning, the Cronet player, the FCM token updater,
  the google-services and play-publishing Gradle plugins, the `playStore`
  signing config and `playRelease` build type. There is now a single build.
- **Google Play Services**, which survived the flavor removal because it entered
  transitively through the Breez Spark SDK's dependency on
  `androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth`. The Spark wallet
  backend was already returning a disabled service and discarding its
  collaborators, so it cost 17.8 MB of native code per ABI and the whole
  play-services auth/fido stack for no runtime behaviour. NWC remains the only
  wallet transport; `Wallet.Spark` stays so the Room migrations keep resolving.
- **Primal Premium**: Legend/OG tiers, primal names, leaderboards, content
  rebroadcast, media management and the in-app purchase flow — 138 files and
  14,742 lines. The Legend avatar glow, coloured verification badge and profile
  premium badge go with it; the plain verified badge and live-stream ring stay.
  None of it could function without Primal's servers.

### Changed

- The release workflow was still upstream's: it filtered `ios-*` tags, ran PR
  checks on macOS runners inherited from a repository that also built an iOS
  XCFramework, published an AAB to Google Play, built a second APK for a crash
  reporter whose upload is a no-op, collapsed the three ABI splits onto one
  `primal-<tag>.apk` and opened a draft release called "Primal". Both workflows
  also decoded absent google-services secrets over committed files, which is why
  every tagged run failed with "Malformed root json". They now build the ABI
  splits, refuse to publish debug-signed APKs and take their body from this file.
- Highlights are fetched relay-only; the repository no longer takes a cache client.

### Fixed

- Two test fixtures left behind by the relay-only migration: the app-config
  handler test still asserted that well-known discovery reached the store, and
  the tags test still expected the Primal relay default.

Release APK: 78.6 MB at 0.1.1, 55.2 MB now.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-31

Localization, unread badges and feed ordering, plus the fixes from the
2026-08-31 audit ([`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md`](docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md)).

### Added

- In-app language selection with 26 translations (Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech,
  Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish,
  Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese,
  Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Chinese) and an
  Android `localeConfig`.
- Unread badges for messages and notifications, computed from the local
  database instead of a remote counter.
- A "mark all as read" action in the notifications list, and local
  mark-all-as-read for direct message conversations.
- A new-notes indicator on the home tab, and an optional automatic feed
  refresh when the app returns to the foreground.
- `wss://nostr.wine` in the fallback relay set.

### Changed

- Feeds are ordered by event timestamp rather than insertion position, so a
  relay reconnect can no longer shuffle the timeline. Notification ordering
  gained a stable tie-break on notification id.
- Interaction counters are resolved from relays for reposts and for the notes
  in an opened thread, and the feed is invalidated once they arrive so visible
  cards redraw without navigating away.
- Notification previews now fetch the events their `e` tag references, so
  likes, zaps and reposts render an actual note body.
- Paging loads 50 notes initially and 20 per subsequent page.
- A relay query whose first EOSE carries no events now waits for the remaining
  relays instead of returning empty.
- Added `avif`, `svg` and `ico` to the recognized media types.

### Security

- Direct-message and mute-list queries are no longer broadcast to the hardcoded
  public fallback relays when the account has its own relays configured.
  Previously, opening the messages tab disclosed the user's pubkey and reading
  activity to seven third-party relay operators regardless of configuration.
- An empty relay snapshot no longer clears the cached feed. Offline or slow
  relays used to wipe the local timeline on every foreground, leaving nothing
  to fall back on.
- Relay connection status is now cleared when a relay closes the socket. The
  teardown path cancelled its own coroutine, so the closed callback never ran
  and dead relays kept reporting as connected.
- Replaced two uses of `kotlin.runCatching` with the project's
  cancellation-safe `runCatching`, which no longer converts coroutine
  cancellation into a logged failure.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-30

Initial LibreNostr release. Every active Android data path now talks to
Nostr relays directly instead of a Primal cache server.

### Added

- Relay-only data layer: feeds (**Latest**, **Latest with replies**),
  profiles, follow lists (NIP-65), threads, notifications, direct messages
  (NIP-04), bookmarks (kind 10003), mute lists (kind 10000/10555/30000) and
  live-stream lookup (kind 30311) are all read and written directly against
  configured relays.
- Relay-only Reads: article feed, article details/comments (NIP-22/NIP-23)
  and highlights (NIP-84), replacing the Primal Articles API.
- Relay-only Explore: profile search, popular people, trending topics/zaps
  and note reaction/repost action lists, with NIP-50 search where available.
- Relay-only polls (kind 1068/6969/1018) and NIP-57 zap receipts (kind 9735),
  including invoice-to-zap enrichment.
- `RelayPool` REQ/EOSE/CLOSE subscription API with dedupe, timeouts and
  bounded concurrent subscriptions (capped at 64).
- LibreNostr branding: app name, launcher icon, `nostrich.org` deep links
  (`/home`, `/reads`, `/notifications`, `/p/<npub>`) replacing `primal://`
  and `primal.net`.
- Project documentation: `docs/UPSTREAM.md`, `docs/BASELINE.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE_UPSTREAM.md`, `docs/PRIMAL_SERVER_DEPENDENCIES.md`,
  `docs/LIBRENOSTR_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/LIBRENOSTR_BACKLOG.md`,
  `docs/RELAY_ONLY_MIGRATION_STATUS.md`, `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.
- ABI-split release APK packaging (`armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`) and
  an `alternative` signing config independent of Google Play signing.

### Changed

- `SocketModule` injects a fail-closed `RelayOnlyApiClient`; the legacy
  shared `PrimalApiClientFactory` / `PrimalHttpApiClientFactory` throw
  instead of silently reconnecting to a centralized cache.
- Wallet: NWC (NIP-47) is the only enabled in-app wallet transport. Legacy
  Primal-wallet payment/balance/invoice paths and centralized NWC
  provisioning are fail-closed; zaps and invoice links fall back to the
  Android `lightning:` intent when NWC isn't configured.
- Local credential storage now uses Android Keystore AES-GCM (versioned
  format v2, 128-bit auth tag); legacy CBC files are readable only for
  migration, with no plaintext fallback.
- Android backup is disabled (`allowBackup=false`) and backup/data-extraction
  rules exclude all app data; cleartext network traffic is disabled.
- Note counters, event stats and zap totals are now aggregated locally from
  relay-observed events instead of Primal's synthetic stats payload.

### Removed

- Firebase Cloud Messaging registration and `PrimalFirebaseMessagingService`;
  push token methods remain as local no-ops so no device token or signed
  authorization event reaches a central service.
- Primal well-known profile resolution, follow-pack remote paging, DVM
  featured-feed discovery, advanced-search parsing endpoint, and the
  Primal Articles/EventStats/Settings remote APIs on the active path.
- Primal deep links (`primal://`, `primal.net` app-link intents) and the
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` template inherited from upstream.

### Security

- Full audit results and verification evidence (build/test/lint runs, APK
  manifest and string scans, log review) are in `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.
- No `primal.net`, Firebase, `primal://`/`primalconnect://` or
  `nostrnwc+primal` references remain reachable from the active production
  code path; the compiled APK was scanned to confirm this.

### Known limitations

- Wallet/premium/external-signer UI and compatibility modules — including
  the optional Breez/Spark native wallet library — remain compiled in;
  their centralized transports are fail-closed but the modules themselves
  are scheduled for removal.
- The internal package namespace is still `net.primal.android`; renaming it
  is deferred until after the networking migration, per
  `docs/LIBRENOSTR_ROADMAP.md`.
