OUTKAST is an independent social client built from the LibreNostr and [Primal Android](https://github.com/PrimalHQ/primal-android-app) foundations. It keeps the mature Android/Compose and protocol layers while presenting a simpler product organized around Feed, Discover, Inbox and You.

The target architecture is:

```text
client  <->  Nostr relays  +  local Room/DataStore
```

The imported codebase still contains upstream namespaces and compatibility services. Those are being removed incrementally, path by path, instead of hiding the remaining dependencies behind a rebrand.

The current release is [`v2.2.1`](https://github.com/Lwb89dev/outkast/releases/tag/v2.2.1). Release APKs
are signed, `arm64-v8a` only, and published from the [`altRelease`](https://github.com/Lwb89dev/outkast/releases)
build variant.

## Current state

**100% of active Android data paths are relay-native.** Feeds, profiles, threads,
notifications, direct messages, search, bookmarks, mute lists, articles and
zaps are all read and written directly against Nostr relays; no Primal cache
or aggregation server is required for any of them. Full detail and
verification evidence: [`docs/RELAY_ONLY_MIGRATION_STATUS.md`](docs/RELAY_ONLY_MIGRATION_STATUS.md)
and [`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`](docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md).

- direct relay read/write through `RelayPool`, including EOSE handling, timeouts, deduplication and clean subscription shutdown;
- relay-first feeds (**Latest**, **Latest with replies**), profiles, follow lists, threads, notifications, direct messages (NIP-04), bookmarks, mute lists and live-stream lookup;
- relay-first Reads: article feed, article details/comments (NIP-22/NIP-23) and highlights (NIP-84);
- relay-first Explore: profile search, popular people, trending topics/zaps and note reaction/repost action lists;
- relay-first polls (kind 1068/6969/1018) and zap receipts (NIP-57, kind 9735), including invoice-to-zap enrichment;
- local-key note publishing to write relays, with the published event persisted locally;
- NWC (NIP-47) as the only in-app wallet transport; legacy centralized/embedded wallet, premium and FCM push services are removed or fail closed;
- Android Keystore AES-GCM local credential storage, disabled Android backup, HTTPS-only/cleartext-disabled networking;
- OUTKAST Dark and OUTKAST Light, a focused editorial Compose system, and four primary destinations: Feed, Discover, Inbox and You;
- profile sharing through `nostrich.org/p/<npub>` and Android deep-link handling;
- inline search: profile results appear below the search field and note/read results render in the same screen, without an intermediate results page;
- persistent recent searches and recent profiles, capped at five entries per group and shown with profile images;
- note composer attachments, camera/gallery selection, polls and a GIF picker backed by Wikimedia Commons previews.
- deck mode on tablets held in landscape: several named decks of drag-and-drop columns (feeds, hashtags, profiles, Reads, notifications, messages), with notes, profiles and DMs opening inside their column; phones and portrait tablets keep the tabbed layout.

The Android application ID intentionally remains `com.librenostr.android` so signed OUTKAST releases can update existing LibreNostr installations without losing identities, databases, relay settings, wallet connections or Android Keystore material. The internal namespace remains `net.primal.android` until a separately verified namespace-only migration is safe; it is not the product identity.

### Network routing and Tor

OUTKAST supports three network modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Direct | Tor is off and connections use the ordinary network path. |
| Tor for everything | All supported connections use Tor. If Tor is unavailable, the connection fails instead of falling back to a direct path. |
| Only `.onion` addresses | `.onion` destinations use Tor; clearnet destinations remain direct and are not hidden. |

When a Tor mode is selected, relay WebSockets, HTTP requests, media, uploads and web pages follow
the selected route. Relay connections are re-established when the mode changes, and destinations
that must use Tor are never resolved or fetched directly.

Tor can run through either the external Orbot SOCKS proxy or the built-in Arti engine. Built-in Tor
is bundled as a native `arm64-v8a` library, so no additional app is required. The Android build is
therefore distributed as an `arm64-v8a` split only.

## Remaining boundaries

OUTKAST still carries compatibility boundaries inherited from upstream. In particular:

- wallet/premium/external-signer UI and compatibility modules remain in the imported tree; their centralized transports are fail-closed but the modules themselves (including the optional Breez/Spark native library) are still compiled in and scheduled for removal;
- some upstream class, package and module names (e.g. `networking-primal`, `domain-primal`) still reflect the original codebase;
- historical test fixtures and event text may still reference the upstream domain; these are not live endpoints.

Remaining paths and phased removal are tracked in [`docs/LIBRENOSTR_ROADMAP.md`](docs/LIBRENOSTR_ROADMAP.md).

## Project layout

| Directory | Role |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Android application, Compose screens, navigation and feature wiring |
| `core/` | Networking, caching, media, cryptography and shared UI primitives |
| `data/` | Local databases, remote APIs and repository implementations |
| `domain/` | Platform-independent Nostr, feed, profile and wallet models |
| `tools/arti-build/` | Pinned Rust/Arti JNI wrapper build and reproducibility scripts for built-in Tor |
| `docs/` | Architecture notes, dependency inventory and migration roadmap |

## Building

Requires JDK 21 and an Android SDK with compile SDK 37. The project uses AGP 9.2.1, Kotlin 2.4.0 and min SDK 26.
The Android application is packaged for `arm64-v8a` only. The built-in Tor native library is already
committed under `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`; rebuilding it separately requires the pinned toolchain
documented in [`tools/arti-build/README.md`](tools/arti-build/README.md).

There is a single build: OUTKAST ships without Google Play services, Play Billing, ML Kit or Firebase, so there is no flavor dimension.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64   # or another JDK 21 path
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"

# sdk.dir is written to gitignored local.properties
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > local.properties

./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

The AOSP debug APK has been compiled, installed and exercised through ADB during the current development cycle. Debug builds do not encrypt stored keys (`NoEncryption`); do not use a debug APK with a valuable real `nsec`.

### Release builds

Create a gitignored `config.properties` in the repository root with the `alternative` signing
properties. The keystore itself must stay outside Git:

```properties
alternative.storeFile=/path/to/librenostr-release.jks
alternative.storePassword={KeystorePassword}
alternative.keyAlias={KeyAlias}
alternative.keyPassword={KeyPassword}
```

The optional `localStorage.keyAlias` property can also be supplied when configuring the release
storage key. Build and install the signed release with:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleAltRelease --no-daemon
./gradlew :app:installAltRelease --no-daemon
```

The APK is written to
`app/build/outputs/apk/altRelease/outkast-<version>-arm64-v8a.apk`.

## Releases

Signed release APKs (`altRelease`, `arm64-v8a` only) are published on the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Lwb89dev/outkast/releases) page. The latest release is
[`v2.2.1`](https://github.com/Lwb89dev/outkast/releases/tag/v2.2.1). Verify the APK signature
before installing:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs outkast-<version>-<abi>.apk
```
