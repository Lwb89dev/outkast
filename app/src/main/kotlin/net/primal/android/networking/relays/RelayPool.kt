         * 8-wide semaphore), and — once that page lands — an event-stats fetch that queries 4
         * interaction kinds in parallel with no limit at all, and Paging3 kicks off the next
         * page's APPEND before the REFRESH above has even finished. None of those share any
         * state, so in the worst case 15+ concurrent [query] calls each broadcast a REQ to the
         * same handful of relay sockets within milliseconds of each other, and a single feed page
         * measured on-device needed ~60-125 [query] calls in total.
         *
         * A rejection (nostr.mom and offchain.pub, confirmed via captured device logs, reject a
         * socket's REQ outright once too many land on it close together) now fails that relay leg
         * in milliseconds instead of riding out [SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT] (see
         * `RelayRejectedRequestException` in [queryOneRelay]). A second, independent bug used to
         * compound this: every relay's subscription stayed open until the *whole* query() call
         * settled across all 7 relays, not just until that relay's own EOSE — so a relay that
         * answered in well under a second (confirmed via an isolated probe: offchain.pub does)
         * still counted as open for up to [SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT] whenever some other relay in the
         * same call was slower. [queryOneRelay] now closes each relay's subscription the moment
         * *it* answers, which the same probe confirmed removes the rejections outright on its own
         * (20 "too many concurrent REQs" down to 0, identical request pattern against a fresh
         * connection).
         *
         * With both of those fixed, raising this cap past 4 was re-tried twice more, expecting the
         * removed risk to make a wider cap pay off — both times it measured slower instead (12.2s/
         * 24.3s at 4 vs. 17.5s/29.6s and 17.8s/33.9s at 8, first-stage/full-cycle, same feed), with
         * "too many concurrent REQs" reappearing despite the fixes above. On the relays this
         * account actually uses, sending more *new* REQs into the same instant seems to matter on
         * its own, independent of how quickly they then close. 4 is the empirically faster value,
         * confirmed across four separate on-device measurements, not a theoretical one — re-measure
         * on-device (a cold-start run and a warm one both, since cache state changes how many calls
         * a page needs and confounds a same-session before/after comparison) before changing it.
