 * is pure protocol interpretation and lives separately in `net.primal.domain.posts` (see
 * [immediateParentId]); there is no ambiguity there the way there is with timestamps, which some
 * clients get wrong. The thread screen used to ignore that and sort everything after the opened
 * note by timestamp alone, in two buckets (the thread author, then everyone else). A reply to a
 * reply looked identical to a reply to the opened note itself, both rendered at the same rank, and
 * the second one to arrive could appear ahead of the reply it was actually answering.
 *
 * The result pairs each reply with how deep it sits, for the UI to draw one vertical bar per
 * level, and orders the flat list as a depth-first walk: a reply is always immediately followed
 * by its own replies, before any sibling's. A reply whose named parent is neither [rootId] nor
 * anywhere in [this] — the parent exists somewhere, just not in what this fetch brought back — is
 * placed at level 1 with [ReplyPlacement.hasKnownParent] `false`, rather than pretending it is a
 * confirmed direct reply to what was opened. It still shows: the alternative is not "correctly
 * nested," it is "silently missing," which is worse.
 *
 * Within one parent's replies, [rootAuthorId]'s own are shown first, oldest first — a continued
 * thought reads top to bottom — and everyone else's after that, newest first.
