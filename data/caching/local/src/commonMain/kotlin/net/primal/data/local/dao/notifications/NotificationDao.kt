    // Both notification lists below (seen, unseen) leave out whatever was done by a user the owner
    // muted. The mute list used to be applied to feeds and threads only, so a muted person kept
    // appearing in Notifications with every reply, mention, reaction and zap, which is the place a
    // muted person is most visible to the one who muted them. NOT EXISTS rather than NOT IN so a
    // notification with no actor (a null actionUserId) is still shown instead of silently dropped.

     * The seen feed, with follows collapsed to one row per local day.
     *
     * Grouping happens here rather than after paging because a page boundary must not be able to
     * split a day in two: the rows that belong together are decided before anything is paged.
     * [utcOffsetSeconds] shifts the day boundary to the reader's timezone, so the bucket matches
     * the date the screen prints next to it.
     *
     * MAX(n.createdAt) is what makes the remaining bare columns come from the newest row of each
     * group, so a collapsed day is represented by its most recent follower.
     *
     * The count is of people rather than of rows. Rows written before follows were keyed by
     * follower and day are still duplicated in existing databases, and counting them would say
     * fifteen people followed you on a day when three did.
