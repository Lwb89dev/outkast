/**
 * Decides whether a fetch has to be sent at all, and who is waiting for the answer.
 *
 * Every repository used to talk to the relays on its own. Nothing knew what anything else had
 * asked for, so the same question went out several times over: the active user's follow list is
 * requested independently by the note feed, the article feed, advanced search, explore and the
 * profile screen, and at app start those load together. Profile metadata is worse, because two
 * screens showing the same author each asked for kind 0 separately.
 *
 * This sits between the repositories and [RelayEventQuerier] and answers one question: is somebody
 * already asking this? If so the caller attaches to the request in flight instead of opening
 * another one. It is deliberately *not* a cache of events — that is Room's job, and the in-memory
 * hot layer in front of it already exists. What lives here is the set of requests currently in the
 * air and the consumers waiting on each.
 *
 * The querier is passed per call rather than held, so this stays a plain process-wide singleton
 * with no mutable wiring to race over. The registry is keyed by [FetchKey] alone, which assumes
 * the single transport the app actually has; a second one would need the key to say which.
 *
 * Two mechanisms that are easy to confuse, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *  - **coalescing**, here: concurrent callers wanting the same thing share one request. Nobody
 *    ever sees staler data than they would have without it, so it is always safe.
 *  - **session claiming**, in the event cache: a pubkey is asked about once per session and never
 *    again. That trades freshness for traffic, which is right for a feed and wrong for the profile
 *    screen, so it stays opt-in and is not applied here.
